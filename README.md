  ## Description  ‚úèÔ∏è
  
  This code will prompt the user for the usual README sections and generate a README.md file for their project. The generated README will be able to include emojis, a table of contents (TOC), and proper formatting. It supports multiple screenshots, which must be located in either the /assets/images or src/assets/images folder of the project. The README.md file is assumed to be output or manually moved to the root of the project's directory. The output location for the README.md can be selected using inquirer-select-directory and placed anywhere on the user's machine.
