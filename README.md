# Read-Me-Generator
README.md Generator

## Description

This code will prompt the user for the usual README sections and generate a README.md file for their project. The generated README will be able to include emojis, a table of contents (TOC), and proper formatting. It supports multiple screenshots, which must be located in either the /assets/images or src/assets/images folder of the project. The README.md file is assumed to be output or manually moved to the root of the project's directory. The output location for the README.md can be selected using inquirer-select-directory and placed anywhere on the user's machine.

* Edit
Now with support for adding tech badges. 

* This README.md was created using this program, and therefore I have my screenshots in the /assets/images folder.

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

After you clone the repo, install using "npm i" and update the default email to your own. Then you will be able to run this CLI using the command.

```
readme
```

You can run this code from any directory on your computer. The code will ask for the output directory, starting from the level you are currently running the 'readme' command from. It assumes your terminal is open to your project's root directory and you want your README in the root. You may navigate up and down directories as needed to select a different location for the README.md file.

### Deployed Link

CLI only.

### Screenshots

* Add Sreenshots...

'src/assets/images'
